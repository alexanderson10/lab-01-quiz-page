            <content>
                <p>Hello, my name is Alex Anderson. I was born and raised in the small town of Packwood, Wa, that was
                    once known for its logging industry but is now a community realiant upon tourism. Growing up all I
                    wanted to do was play baseball
                    , there wasn't a time of day that I wouldn't
                    want to be playing. Playing baseball would take me on many great journeys. I started playing travel
                    baseball and going around the northwest to play games when I was 7 years old. This would only
                    continue and grow as I kept playing the game I loved.
                    I was fortunate enough to recieve multiple scholarship offers to play at the university level. I
                    ultimately accepted a scholarship to New Mexico Highlands University where I played until my
                    shoulder gave out.
